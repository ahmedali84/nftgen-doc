# User Guide
## Generate
### Trait
A trait refers to a specific characteristic or element that can be present on an NFT. It's a building block that, when combined with others, contributes to the overall visual and metadata makeup of each unique NFT in the collection.
#### Examples
- Skin Color
- Eyewear
- Background
#### Traits Types
![](./README_FILES/blender_a8TDo7Flab.png)

Traits can be used to control many aspects in the scene, not just `Objects` and `Collections`.
##### On `Materials`, `Images` and `Actions`
These 3 trait types need a `datablock` to be assigned to, the addon looks into all the trait choices and tries to find this `datablock`, otherwise it doesn't know which `datablock` in the scene to operate on, so:
- At least one of the **materials** in a trait needs to be assigned to an **object**.
- At least one of the **images** in a trait needs to be assigned to a **material** (as a texture in the shader nodes tree).
- At least one **action** in a trait needs to be assigned to an **object**. 
### Choice
Choices are the selected attributes to be assigned to a [trait](#Trait).
#### Examples
- Skin Color: Brown
- Eyewear: Sunglasses
- Background: Blue
#### Rarity
A percentage that resembles (approximately) how frequently a choice will be assigned to a trait.
##### Example
![](./README_FILES/blender_D6EMYBsgls.png)

`Pirate Eyepatch` will show up only in 10% of the tokens.
##### Max Unique Tokens
Is the maximum count of tokens that can be generated from all the assigned traits and choices, this number does not account for changes in `Rarity` and `Rules`.
### Rules
Rules let you say "yes, this goes together" or "no, that's not allowed" for different traits, shaping your collection's look and rarity.
#### Never With
Never associate Choice 1 and Choice 2 in the same token
#### Only With
Pick Choice 2 whenever Choice 1 exists
#### Always Pair With
Always associate Choice 1 and Choice 2 together, whenever any of them exists, the other should be assigned
#### Example
![](./README_FILES/blender_632B9aw5Yt.png)
1. `Sunglasses` will never show up in `Night` lighting.
2. `Blonde Moustache` will only show up on tokens with `Yellow Skin`.
3. Any token with `Pirate Eyepatch` will always use a `Pirate Sword` and vice versa.
## Edit
### Navigate Tokens
 ![](./README_FILES/blender_5YmE7ywauh.png)

 Change `Active Token` value to navigate through the collection, the addon will update the viewport to reflect the active token choices.
### Edit Individual Token Traits
![](./README_FILES/blender_Q9WTdg4Kjr.png)

Ever stare at your NFT collection, wishing you could tweak just one thing here or there? NFT Generator empowers you to change any choice of a token individually to fine tune your perfect collection.
### Tokens Stats
![](./README_FILES/blender_JMB9G4ENUD.png)

The `Token Stats` is a **read only** section that provides a comprehensive overview of your generated collection, revealing the frequency of each trait choice.
## Export
### Output Folder
![](./README_FILES/blender_XopMnzJmMV.png)

- `Output folder` is the parent folder where the rendered images and their metadata files are exported (`render` and `metadata`).
- By default output folder is set to `//` which an eloquent way to say it's the same folder where your blend file is saved, the addon creates the `render` and `metadata` folders for you if they don't exist. 
- `Open Output Folder` is a quick option to open the output folder in your OS file manager.
### Token Metadata
![](./README_FILES/blender_EGz4D3QXrn.png)
- `Description`: A description for your collection.
- `External URL`: The homepage of your collection.
- Token Name: The token id that shows up in the `name` key in metadata file, the hash `#` symbol is a placeholder for the **token number (index)**, you can add any suffix or prefix to it, make sure not to delete the `#` symbol otherwise all the tokens will end up having the same name or image in the collection.

### Render/Export
![](./README_FILES/blender_d5HanXYAWB.png)
- `From` and `To` could be helpful if you had to edit some tokens after all the collection was rendered already, you can assign only the updated ones.
- `Render` to render all your tokens within the `From`: `To` range.
- `Export Metadata` to export all metadata files within the same `From`: `To` range.
